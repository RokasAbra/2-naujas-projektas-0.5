    <h1>The base element</h1>
    <p>
    <img src="images/stickman.gif" width="240 height=390"
    alt="Stickman"> - Notice that we have only specified a elative address for the image. Since we have specified a base  URL in the head section, the browser will look for the image at"</p>
   <p><a href="tags/tag_base.asp">HTML base Tag</a> - Notice that the link opens in a new window, even if it has no target="_blank" attribute. this is because the target attribute of the base element is set to "_blank".</p>  
   <h1>The bdi element</h1>

    <p>In the example below, usernames are shown along with the number of points in a contest. if the bdi element is not supported in the browser, the username of the Arabic user would confuse the text (the bidirectional algorithm would put the colon and the number "90" next to the word "user" rather than next to the word "points").</p>
<ul>
    <li>User <bdi>hrefs</bdi>: 60 points</li>
    <li>User <bdi> jdoe</bdi>: 80 points</li>
    <li>User <bdi> ęčąįš</bdi>: 90 points</li>
</ul>
